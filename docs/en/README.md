# PSD2Live

**Generate a Live2D model from a layered PSD, then refine, rig, animate, simulate and export it in one desktop workspace.**

![PSD2Live editing workspace: hierarchy on the left, the canvas in Deform mode showing the front-hair mesh, model presets and the layer classification table on the right](../imgs/overview.webp)

PSD2Live recognizes parts from layer names and generates meshes, a deformer hierarchy, head, body and facial parameters, basic motions and physics. The generated model is a starting point: keep shaping it on the canvas, cut and subdivide meshes, paint textures, build a skeleton and edit motion curves, then export a `.cmo3` for further work in Cubism Editor or a `.moc3` runtime bundle.

<sub>Automatic result for the bundled example PSD, without manual edits, driven by the head and body angle parameters.</sub>

## Features

| Area | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Automatic rigging | Chinese / English / Japanese layer names, automatic splitting of paired parts, adaptive meshes, head and body deformer chains, eye, mouth, gaze and brow parameters, idle / blink / nod / shake motions, hair and eye-jelly physics |
| Canvas editing | Select / Deform / Edit / Paint modes; deformation brushes, mesh subdivision and cuts, Warp / Rotation creation, Glue and deform paths (experimental) |
| Skeleton | Inferred skeletons for limbs, tails and wings with FK / IK posing, baked on export into native Cubism deformers, parameters and corrective keyforms that run without PSD2Live |
| Swing and physics | Generated lateral / vertical sway with matching pendulums; visual pendulum editing, response curves and chained groups, evaluated to match the Cubism Native Framework |
| Artwork and variants | Transparent image placement, toggle and exclusive variants, layer painting and edge cleanup, optional 2× / 4× texture upscaling |
| Animation | Timeline, keyframe and curve editing with live preview; preset crouch, wave, cheer and other motions when a skeleton is available |
| Projects | Single-file `.psd2live` projects, branching history, tabs, six workspace presets (Edit, Mesh, Rigging, Animation, Preview, Physics), light and dark themes, Photoshop / Blender / Cubism keymaps |
| Agents | Authenticated local MCP server with 170 public tools (discovered page by page through `workspace_list_operations`) for observation, shapes, artwork, parameters, skeletons, motions, physics, simulation, export and history |

## Download

Get the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/tsunehimatoi/psd2live/releases/latest):

| Platform | Package | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows 10 / 11 x64 | Portable ZIP, EXE, MSI | Bundles a Java runtime; extract or install and run |
| Linux x86_64 | Deb | Bundles the runtime and Cubism native preview; requires X11 / GLX (XWayland works) |
| Other | Run from source | Install JDK 21; see [Build from source](#build-from-source) |

The Linux native preview does not support pure Wayland without XWayland, aarch64 or musl (e.g. Alpine); those environments fall back to the built-in renderer. See [Cubism native preview](guide/CUBISM_SDK_SETUP.md).

## Quick start

1. **Import a PSD** with **File → Import → New project from PSD…** (`Ctrl+Shift+O`) or drop it on the window. The Start screen opens next: set the model presets with the Minimal / Default / Full quick choices (Default includes loose clothing simulation) and tick the layers holding several disconnected parts (such as both legs) to split by mesh. Reopen it later from Tools → Start Screen….
2. **Check the classification** in the Layers table: part type, side and variant settings. Correct anything that was misread.
3. **Preview and refine** in the Preview workspace, then adjust in the Edit, Rigging, Animation and Physics workspaces as needed.
4. **Save and export**: `Ctrl+S` saves a `.psd2live` project; `Ctrl+G` opens export settings for `.cmo3` and / or the `.moc3` bundle.

**New to PSD2Live? Open Help → Tutorials… (`F1`).** The interactive tutorials highlight each control and use your current shortcuts. There is a beginner path (18 lessons) and a path for Cubism users (13 lessons); the [user guide](guide/USER_GUIDE.md) is the text companion.

## Preparing artwork

Layer structure matters most for the automatic result:

- Separate eye whites, irises and upper lashes, and keep the part of the iris hidden under the eyelid.
- Provide an open-mouth drawing, or separate upper teeth, lower teeth and tongue.
- Separate front and back hair and leave overlap under covered areas.
- Keep the body roughly upright; rasterize layer effects and text.

See [PSD preparation and naming](spec/PSD_LAYER_SPEC.md) for the full name table. Unrecognized layers are kept and can be classified manually.

## Output files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.psd2live` | PSD2Live project: source PSD, artwork, settings, every edit and all history branches. Save this to keep working |
| `.cmo3` | Cubism Editor model project for inspection and refinement in the official editor |
| `.model3.json` + `.moc3` + textures, physics, motions | Runtime bundle; deliver together and load from `.model3.json` |
| `.psd2live.json` | Export diagnostics, not a project |

Export targets Cubism 3.0 – 5.0 (default 5.0); features the target cannot express are downgraded and reported. A successful export does not guarantee identical results in every runtime, so check the model in the target editor and runtime before delivery. Support boundaries are described in the [runtime and export reference](../zh/spec/RUNTIME_EXPORT_ARCHITECTURE_AND_GAPS.md) (Chinese). Through the neutral rig IR the model also exports to a VTube Studio model, the PSD2Live runtime rig and web player, a layered PSD at a pose, PNG sequences, sprite sheets, GIF and video, each with a loss report; see [export targets](../zh/spec/EXPORT_TARGETS.md) (Chinese).

The built-in renderer needs no official SDK. [Cubism native preview](guide/CUBISM_SDK_SETUP.md) is optional and lets you compare against the official runtime's rendering and physics.

## Connecting an agent (MCP)

1. Keep PSD2Live running and open **Tools → MCP → MCP Connection & Setup…**.
2. Copy the configuration for your host. Hosts with Streamable HTTP connect directly; Stdio-only hosts use [`mcp_proxy.py`](../../mcp_proxy.py) in the repository root.
3. Have the agent call `workspace_inspect` first. Every write goes into the same history as UI edits and can be undone in the app.

The [MCP reference](../zh/agent/MCP_AUTHORING.md) (Chinese) lists requests and examples. The MCP server does not generate images; new artwork requires image generation in the host. A callable tool does not make a complex modeling task reliable; [recorded evaluations](../zh/STATUS.md) keep both successes and failures.

## Build from source

Requires JDK 21; Gradle runs through the bundled wrapper.

```bash
./gradlew run                      # start the GUI (Windows: .\gradlew.bat run or run-gui.bat)
./gradlew run --args="--input examples/tml/psd-input/tml.psd --output build/example-output"   # generate from the command line
./gradlew test                     # run the tests
./gradlew packageDistributionForCurrentOS   # build an installer for this platform
```

Source builds use the built-in renderer. The official Cubism SDK must be obtained separately to build the native bridge. See [development and CLI](guide/DEVELOPMENT.md) for all CLI options, packaging and native builds.
