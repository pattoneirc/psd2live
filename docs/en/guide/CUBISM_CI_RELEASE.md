# Cubism CI and release workflows

[Documentation](../../README.md) · [中文](../../zh/guide/CUBISM_CI_RELEASE.md) · [Cubism native preview](CUBISM_SDK_SETUP.md)

This page describes the two GitHub Actions workflows: public tests (no SDK) and optional Cubism preview packaging. It does not replace the Live2D license or grant redistribution rights for proprietary components.

## The two workflows

| Workflow | File | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CI** | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | On `push` / `pull_request` to `master` (and `main`), runs `./gradlew test` on Ubuntu and Windows. Does not download the Cubism SDK and does not set `PSD2LIVE_INCLUDE_CUBISM`. |
| **Release Cubism** | `.github/workflows/release-cubism.yml` | On manual `workflow_dispatch` or a `v*` tag push, privately fetches the SDK, builds the native bridges, packages Windows/Linux Cubism builds, and can publish a GitHub Release. |

macOS packaging is deferred; this workflow does not build it.

## Public repos and SDK leakage (required reading)

**On a public repository, GitHub Release assets are public.** Do not attach `CubismSdkForNative-*.zip` to a Release on this public application repo.

Recommended approach:

1. Store the SDK zip in a **private sibling repository**, as a prerelease/tag (for example `internal-sdk/cubism-5-r.5`) with asset name `CubismSdkForNative-5-r.5.zip` by default.
2. Set repository variable `CUBISM_SDK_SOURCE_REPO` on this app repo to that private repo (`owner/name`).
3. Set secret `SDK_FETCH_TOKEN` to a PAT (or fine-grained token) that can read that private Release. If unset, the workflow falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which usually **cannot** read another private repo.

Alternative: keep the zip in other private storage and adapt the fetch step; the current workflow uses `gh release download`.

## Variables and secrets

| Name | Kind | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CUBISM_SDK_SOURCE_REPO` | Repository variable | Current `github.repository` | Repo that hosts the SDK Release. **Public app repos must point this at a private repo.** |
| `CUBISM_SDK_RELEASE_TAG` | Repository variable | `internal-sdk/cubism-5-r.5` | Private SDK Release / tag name |
| `CUBISM_SDK_ASSET_NAME` | Repository variable | `CubismSdkForNative-5-r.5.zip` | Asset file name |
| `SDK_FETCH_TOKEN` | Secret | (empty → `GITHUB_TOKEN`) | Used when fetching from a private SDK repo |

## Environment protection

Jobs `build-windows`, `build-linux`, and `release` use the GitHub Environment named **`release-cubism`**. Create it under Settings → Environments and add required reviewers / deployment branch rules so arbitrary collaborators cannot mint SDK-inclusive packages alone.

## Publishing a release

Prerequisites: the SDK zip is uploaded to the private repository, and the variables, secrets and `release-cubism` environment above are configured. `<version>` below stands for the target version, such as `3.0.1`.

1. **Bump the version first.** The workflow does not modify the repository. Set `version` and `packageVersion` in `build.gradle.kts`, update version strings shown in the UI, add the release to `docs/zh/CHANGELOG.md` and update the Release body in `release-cubism.yml` (Chinese first, English in a collapsed `<details><summary>English</summary>` block), then commit and push.
2. Open Actions → **Release Cubism** → **Run workflow** and set `version` to `<version>` (no leading `v`).
3. Keep `create_github_release` enabled unless you only want build artifacts.
4. Approve the environment gate and wait for the Windows and Linux jobs.
5. With publishing enabled, the workflow creates or updates tag `v<version>` as a **formal** (non-prerelease) GitHub Release with:
   - `PSD2Live-<version>-windows-x86_64-portable.zip`
   - `PSD2Live-<version>.exe`
   - `PSD2Live-<version>.msi`
   - each of the three above also with ffmpeg included: `PSD2Live-<version>-windows-x86_64-portable-ffmpeg.zip`, `PSD2Live-<version>-ffmpeg.exe`, `PSD2Live-<version>-ffmpeg.msi`
   - `PSD2Live-<version>-linux-amd64.deb`

Pushing tag `v<version>` triggers the same workflow. Use one entry point to avoid running the full matrix twice.

## Artifacts and platform limits

- Linux preview needs X11/GLX (including XWayland / `xvfb-run`). Pure Wayland, aarch64, and musl/Alpine are unsupported. See [CUBISM_SDK_SETUP](CUBISM_SDK_SETUP.md).
- v1 skips fragile GUI smoke tests; Linux checks that the `.deb` exists and is non-empty.
- Windows packages are built twice: the second pass adds `-Ppsd2live.ffmpegDir=<dir>`, putting a pinned Gyan.dev ffmpeg essentials build (GPLv3; its SHA-256 and the encoders the video and animated image exports use are checked) with its `LICENSE.txt` and `README.txt` into the app's `resources/ffmpeg/`. To update ffmpeg, change both `FFMPEG_URL` and `FFMPEG_SHA256` in the workflow. Linux packages do not include ffmpeg.
- The Windows installers are built by `packageExe` / `packageMsi` from the app image with `packaging/windows/main.wxs` (the JDK 21 jpackage template plus PSD2Live changes): when the app is installed, the installer defaults to its folder and skips the "folder is not empty" question, and a package of the same version (a rebuild, or with/without ffmpeg) replaces the installed one too. Uninstalls and upgrades remove only the installed files instead of emptying the whole install folder as jpackage does by default (an install of 3.0.0 or earlier is removed only after the new version is in place, once the folder it recorded for emptying is cleared). Choosing Remove in the maintenance wizard offers to delete the user's data as well (the app's `--clear-user-data`, run as the current user; a command-line uninstall can pass `PSD2LIVE_CLEAR_DATA=1`), so the product is registered with Modify available. The installer UI is English on every build machine (the added strings are in `PSD2LiveStrings.wxl`; every culture of a .wxl in the resource directory joins the installer's cultures). Packaging checks that jpackage's generated WiX sources still hold the property and component GUID the file refers to, and fails otherwise. Packaging with another major JDK means bringing that file in step with its template.
- Cubism-inclusive packages are only for uses allowed by your license; **do not** redistribute proprietary binaries on public channels.
