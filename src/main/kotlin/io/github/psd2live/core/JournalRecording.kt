 * Edits made on the rig the user sees, written as journal entries for the stage they replay at.
 *
 * The user edits [shown] - the authored rig with every generator run on it - while the journal replays on the
 * authored rig itself, before the generators. So an entry keeps only what that stage reads: a key leaves out the axes
 * the generators add at their defaults ([GeneratedOverrides.journalOnly]), an edit of a keyform a generator makes is
 * merged after the generators as an override or refused ([GeneratedOverrides.capture], [GeneratedOverrides.ownedWrites]),
 * and a generator parameter an entry names is taken into the document before it ([GeneratedParameterAdoption]). The
 * entries then replay on the authored rig to what [shown] showed them doing.
