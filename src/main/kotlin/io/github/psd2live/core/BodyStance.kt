/**
 * How the figure stands on its feet, and how the body moves over them.
 *
 * The body and the legs are two root warps side by side, so nothing that moves the body reaches the floor:
 *
 * - **The body** ([bodyPoint]): a warp over the body's own parts - the torso, the arms, the skirt, the
 *   tail - and the neck the head turns on, never the whole figure. Body X turns the upper body as one
 *   solid about its centre line, waist and chest alike, easing out over the hips: the front of the chest
 *   moves toward the side it turns to, the near shoulder comes forward a little larger and lower, and the
 *   neck, near the axis, hardly moves, so the head stays in the middle of the body. Body Y opens the shoulders a little going down and stretches the back
 *   going up. Under both the whole body moves with the hips: a little sideways on Body X, down onto bent
 *   knees and up onto straightened legs on Body Y.
 * - **The lean and the proportions** ([leanPoint]): a warp under the body on two parameters of its own.
 *   The lean bows the body in three dimensions toward the viewer or back - the pelvis a little about the
 *   hips, the upper body the rest about the waist - seen in perspective; the proportions draw the head
 *   larger over a shorter torso toward a chibi, or the other way. Each arm hangs from its shoulder in a
 *   warp of its own ([armPoint]).
 * - **The legs** ([legPoint]): a warp over the legs alone. Its lowest rows, the feet, stay where they are
 *   drawn; everything above them follows two-bone legs whose hips move with the body. A knee bends
 *   forward, toward the viewer, so a front-facing thigh shortens rather than swinging out sideways, and
 *   turns in or out of that plane by how the pose holds the knees. One warp carries both legs, so legs
 *   drawn on a single layer bend at their own knees too.
 *
 * Legs skinned to bones hang from rotation deformers in the legs warp, which pass on only a pivot and an
 * angle; each of their bones carries its meshes through a warp of its own that puts them where [legPoint]
 * has the legs (see [SkeletonRig]). The leg poses of a skeleton ([SkeletonPoses.legPoses]) are poses of
 * the same model.
